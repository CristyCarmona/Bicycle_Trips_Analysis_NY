# Project Title: Bicycle_Trips_Analysis_NY

### Description 
Citi Bike Program is the nation's largest bike share program, with 14,500 bikes and 950 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Jersey City. It was designed for quick trips with convenience in mind, and it’s a fun and affordable way to get around town.

In this project you will find a usage analysis of the program through a Tableau dashboard. It includes an overall analysis of the frequency of the trips, a customer type, stations, and gender analysis. 

 Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program’s utilization and [here](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) you can find the data source.
